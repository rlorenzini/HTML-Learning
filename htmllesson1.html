<html> html is a top level tag, which means it starts and ends your page.
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="csslearning1.css"></link>
</head>
  <h1>
Head tag is your page header, such as the top of the page, main focus, or such.</h1>

  <body>
    <h3>
Body tag is your main content tag.</h3>
<i>index.html</i> will be your <b>homepage/main page</b> (standard, but not required).
When you open a tag, always close it.<p>Line-breaks must be opened and closed.</p>
<h3>You can search to validate your html on certain webpages, which will tell you if you have headers that do not exist, conflict, aren't closed, etc.</h3>

<!-- in line styles are directly applied in the html document, but it is NOT a good idea. Creating a CSS file and importing is MUCH better.
You only have to refer to the CSS style name to use a full style, and if you have to change one factor of the style you only have to change the style
in the CSS file and not in EVERY INSTANCE I applied that style.
Plus, putting everything into your HTML page makes download times much larger and there is a greater risk of errors.
Your javascript and css files are SAVED in the browser's cache as COOKIES on the machine, whereas the HTML file is downloaded EVERY SINGLE TIME.
That is why a website will load faster the second time you visit it; the majority of the files are saved on your browser.

IN LINE STYLE ALWAYS WINS OVER IMPORTED STYLING. You can take a reusable style and modify it with in line styling without changing the source code.

Testing using a class to style instead of in line styling. Remember, in line styling will always win over imported styling.

<div class="new-style1">CSS files are saved as cookies on the browser. Importing styles from the saved file reduces repeat load times and download sizes.
  Both the client's computer and the creator's server suffer from large HTML file sizes.
